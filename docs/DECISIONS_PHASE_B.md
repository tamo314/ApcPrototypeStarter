# Phase B Decision Log

This file stores architecture/research decisions made during:

**Phase B — Semantic Task Inference & Open-World Extension**

## Numbering

ADR numbers are global across the repository.

Before adding the first Phase B ADR:

1. inspect `docs/DECISIONS.md`;
2. inspect the latest phase-specific decision log;
3. use the next unused `ADR-NNNN`;
4. never renumber historical ADRs.

## Required ADR fields

For each decision record:

- date;
- ADR number and title;
- status;
- task ID;
- decision;
- evidence / reason;
- consequences;
- affected active documents;
- whether downstream tasks are blocked;
- run artifact paths when evidence is empirical.

## Phase B decisions that require an ADR

At minimum, add an ADR when:

- a sealed family is retired because its result changed the design;
- a STOP GATE fails;
- an adequacy threshold changes;
- a search budget changes after gate measurement;
- a Task Inference modality requires an architecture change;
- a pretrained model is proposed (normally out of scope);
- a causal invariant must change;
- the Phase B final verdict is recorded.

Do not preallocate ADR numbers in this scaffold.
